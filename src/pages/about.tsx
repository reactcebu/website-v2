        <p>
          We, <strong>React Cebu</strong>, aims to spread the usage of React JS
          and other JavaScript technologies to the community by organizing free
          meetups, workshops, code camps, trainings and more. Through these, we
          hope to create a friendly, inclusive, and positive space for our
          community members to engage and excel in this area. This is also to
          uplift other developers through free learning, knowledge sharing and
          collaboration. Ultimately, we hope to help in fostering cutting edge
          developers in Cebu City.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe in the importance of finding your tribe — the people who'll
          be your cheerleaders, you'll grow and learn with — and that's what
          React Cebu hopes to be.
