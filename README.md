## Technology Stack

This site is made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). We're using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and we understand that this may seem to put off new developers but don't worry, our TypeScript setting is forgiving so you could work with just JS knowledge only. For styling, we're using popular CSS-In-JS [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

To learn more about Gatsby 🎓, see below:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

To quickly learn TypeScript (TS), the [5 minutes guide is a good place to start](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html). Check out their [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) which comes handy should you need more info.
